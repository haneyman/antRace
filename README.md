PL Coding Test

Typescript React project using create react app.  Clone, `npm install`, then `npm start` to run.

I believe this meets the requirements of the coding test.  Disclaimer:  I previously used the "old school" React way of components and classes but I wanted to do it the more modern way of functional with hooks.  So I am using hooks and functions for the first time, probably need some refinement on how things are organized.  I think I have used up the allotted time :) but I would definitely break things down in to components if I spent more time on it as well as added redux to handle the async calculations.
